	<p> Project 1: Sculptris <br>
Introduction: <br>
		
	
I decided for my project I would be exploring 3D modelling using the program Sculptris to make a variety of 3D objects, utilising the tools included in the program.<br>
Results:
In the space of four weeks I was able to create a spread of about 4 objects, 2 of which I thought were actually presentable. This included 1 I had made on an online program, Sculpt.gl. Efficiently saving from a browser was inefficient and led to confusing about what file was the latest version and how to display it. Using the program with a mouse was also made it a lot more finicky and precision was hard to achieve.<br>

Method:
Using both Sculptris and Scultp.gl I tried to make 3D objects with a 2D reference image.<br>

Conclusion:
In the time I achieved a lot less then I would have hoped to. This was more down to lack of effort and motivation and not technical limitations. In future I would hope to plan out my work time more effectively and improve the quality of what I am making. Also organizing my better.<br>
